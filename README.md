I'm a passionate software engineer currently interning at Dialpad, where I integrate systems and tackle bugs across iOS, Android, and Linux platforms. I love building tools that solve real-world problems, from enterprise solutions to photography booking platforms.

### 💼 Experience

- **Computrol Systems**: Saved 2 hours/day with CI/CD tools and shell scripts; improved customer onboarding and legacy VB6 support.
- **Intersystem Controls**: Automated licensing and inventory tools, rebuilt systems in React, and improved team velocity.

### 💡 Projects
